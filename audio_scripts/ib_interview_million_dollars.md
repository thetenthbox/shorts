Let's say your sitting in an interview at a firm like Goldman Sachs, where they then ask you - "What would you do with a million dollars?"

To start off, it probably wouldnt land well if you said you were going to buy a new Porsche 911.

They want to know how to think about oppurtunity. 

So here's how you answer:

"A million dollars is meaningful, but it's not retire-forever money. So naturally I'd like to invest it in some way shape or form"

After this, you could take two approaches. A safe bet would be to talk about investing it into the markets: stocks, bonds, ETFs, describing where to long and short in terms of sectors and geography, explaining your rationale. 

A more creative approach, would be to have a sort of business plan handy. One answer we've heard from a student revolved around buying used lab diamond synthesizers from China, and then setting it up to sell 2 carat stones or larger in the international diamond markets. 

The approach involved explaining the rationale, the market oppurtunity, and how everything would be executed in practice - adding on to the creativeness of the approach. 

An answer like this leaves a lasting impression in what was otherwise a mundane day of repeating interviews.

If someone asked you that question, what would be your response?
