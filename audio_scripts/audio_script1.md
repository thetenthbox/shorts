Let's say you're working at a bulge bracket investment bank on Wall Street. Your senior associate ... is ripping you to shreds over a financial model YOU think looks good. He starts picking it apart, but you're not exactly clear what went wrong. 



So, what do you do?





Do you leave it be and apologize, scared to fight back with a senior colleague in hopes of securing a full time offer?



or do you defend your model, knowing you're in the right, and that your other colleagues had a look at it before he did?



or do you try to walk through their logic, even if you know you don't have much time?



Now, let's get something straight. Your colleagues work their full-time, you ... kinda don't as an intern. But it doesn't mean you're going to let them steam roll you. 

This kind of conflict is going to happen all the time in IB.

People are busy, stressed, half the context is missing, and you're passing work between like 6 different people.

So your goal isn't to "win" the argument.

Your goal is to get aligned fast ... and ship clean work.

Here's how you wade through it:

Ask for the one thing.
"What's the biggest issue if we fix it right now?"

Then repeat it back.
"Got it — so the concern is X, because Y?"

Now you have clarity, not noise.

Then you commit to a timeline.
"I'll fix this, resend, and flag anything else that still looks off."

And after? Send a quick recap.
What changed, why it changed, and what you want them to confirm.

Sometimes all it takes is a bit of ego stroking; you want to walk away with a job, not walk away winning the argument. 

That's how you handle pressure in IB without getting walked over ... or wasting everyone's time.
